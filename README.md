Some possibly useful program modules

This folder has an "old progs" folder used for the "angry bots" team in 2016. They are
included here in case different components of these old programs are useful this year.
The components and possible uses are noted here:

1. line.ev3	    				This uses a PID (proportional integral derivative) myblock
								to help the robot follow the black line smoothly.
2. Angry_Bots_10_Master.ev3		This includes a "master" program that organizes and
								controls the different mission programs.
3. MBS_move.ev3s				Two myblocks to help the robot move more efficiently; the
								first allows the robot to move a specified # of inches; 
								the second module allows the robot to turn a specified
								number of degrees using the gyro.
